# Scala-Coursera
Author: Jinling XING jinling.xing@polymtl.ca <br>
I study this course on the Coursera is because I need Scala to do my research project. <br>
**I used the IDE: IntelliJ and the "sbt".**
## Week 1
This week is about recursion, the exercises are: Pascal's Triangle; Parentheses Balancing; Counting change.

## Week 2
This week is the operations of set, including union, intersect, difference, filter, forall and exist. <br>
We also need to write the test document to test the functions.
